In this repository there we try to leverage the blockchain to develop sustainable solutions aiming to help the environment.

One first example is global warming:

Quick intro about global warming
I don't know if you are aware of the problem we are facing with green house gases (GHG) and global warming, during the COP21 conference in Paris (previously kyoto protocol) it has been discuss the urgence to find an alternative to the crude oil consumption, alternative energies, ... to decrease the CO2 emissions. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) constantly studies the change in CO2 concentration in the athmosphere and simulate scenarios developed by considering various possible futures of world development in the 21st century (google IPCC scenarios). Long story short, if we don't decrease the carbon footprint we will largely cross the objective of a temperature increase of 1.5 °C as well as 2°C (this means very bad consequences for our planet).
